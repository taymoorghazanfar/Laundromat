This project aims to create a mobile-based solution so that the customers can easily book laundry pick and drop services (i.e., washing, dry clean, steam iron, etc.) for their fabrics (i.e., clothes, blankets, curtains, etc.). after selecting a particular laundry (the laundry can be either home-based or shop based), customer can send their order details to the selected laundry. Upon a successful confirmation by the laundry, a delivery boy would be able to pick up the fabric items from the address of the customer and drop it off at the laundry specified by the customer. Upon receiving the fabric items to be cleaned, the laundry would process the items according to the specified requirements (i.e., washing, steam iron, no bleach, etc.). after the cleaning process has been completed, the laundry would send the cleaned items back to the customer via a delivery boy. Upon successful handover of the items to the customer, the order would be completed successfully.
